    documentation="&lt;languages xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;>&lt;nl-NL>Het uitvoeren en verslagleggen van endoscopisch onderzoek.&lt;/nl-NL>&lt;en-US>&quot;A viewing tube (endoscope) is used to directly observe the inside of body organs or spaces (cavities). Most often, a flexible endoscope is used, but in some cases, a rigid one is more useful. The tip of the endoscope is usually equipped with a light and a camera, so the examiner watches the images on a television monitor rather than looking directly through the endoscope. Tools are often passed through a channel in the endoscope. One type of tool is used to cut and remove tissue samples.&#xA;Endoscopy usually consists of passing the viewing tube through an existing body opening, such as the following:&#xA;·      Nose: To examine the voice box (laryngoscopy) or the lungs (bronchoscopy)&#xA;·      Mouth: To examine the esophagus (esophagoscopy), stomach (gastroscopy), and small intestine (upper gastrointestinal endoscopy)&#xA;·      Anus: To examine the large intestine, rectum, and anus (coloscopy)&#xA;·      Urethra: To examine the bladder (cystoscopy)&#xA;·      Vagina: To examine the uterus (hysteroscopy)&#xA;However, sometimes an opening in the body must be created. A small cut (incision) is made through the skin and the layers of tissue beneath the skin, so that the endoscope can be passed into a body cavity. Such incisions are used to view the inside of the following:&#xA;·      Joints (arthroscopy)&#xA;·      Abdominal cavity (laparoscopy)&#xA;·      Area of the chest between the lungs (mediastinoscopy)&#xA;·      Lungs and pleura (thoracoscopy)&quot;&lt;/en-US>&lt;/languages>">
